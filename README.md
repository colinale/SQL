During this challenge I had the opportunity to learn a lot about SQL which is something I have been looking to get into since the beginning. Part of what I'm wanting to do after taking this course is data analytical work and SQL is a huge part of that. This week was definitely tough but I had a good time learning everything as it was a more interesting topic for me. The professor, TA's, and tutors are always a huge help as usual and I'm happy to have them by myside. I've been also struggling with COVID this past week so it's been a crazy week between everything going on. I like how SQL allows me to organize and categorize things easier and make it look prettier.
